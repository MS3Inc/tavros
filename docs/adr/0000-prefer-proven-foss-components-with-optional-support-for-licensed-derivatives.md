# Prefer Proven FOSS Components with Optional Support for Licensed Derivatives

## Context and Problem Statement

Should we include licensed or non-FOSS components in the Troubadour platform for a given component or component's feature?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Total cost of ownership
* Providing the necessary features for a competitive product

## Decision Outcome

We will prioritize FOSS components, while providing optional support for paid or licensed derivatives, e.g.: Elastic Stack Open Source vs Enterprise subscription, Apache Camel vs JBoss Fuse, etc.

Ultimately total cost of ownership will be the deciding factor for our customers when comparing to established alternatives. There are many FOSS components that address different concerns that we can incorporate and still provide a best-in-class platform.

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* High number of components to configure and integrate
