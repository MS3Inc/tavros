# Prefer Kong Enterprise Edition

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: @k2merlinsix
* Date: 2020-11

## Context and Problem Statement

Given that we've chosen Kong as our Ingress Controller and API Gateway, but we're still missing an API Manager and Developer Portal.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Feature set

## Decision Outcome

We'll recommend Kong enterprise edition in order to enable API manager and developer portal features. API manager and developer portal features are not necessary but they are valuable, supporting Kong EE as an optional component is an acceptable compromise to offer that value to our customers.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Single component for all API related functionality

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Requires a license
