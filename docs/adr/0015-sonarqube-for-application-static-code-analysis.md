# Sonarqube for Application Static Code Analysis

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: @jam01
* Date: 2020-10

## Context and Problem Statement

We understand the value of automated code qualitative analysis and that it's often an afterthought. Should we bundle a static code analysis component?

## Decision Outcome

We'll use Sonarqube for application static code analysis. As part of our effort to offer a ready best-practices platform we'll setup Sonarqube and tie it into template or default CI/CD pipelines.
