## Tavros Roadmap

The Tavros team will publish a roadmap for each major and minor release based on product strategy and business objectives. The latest roadmap shows current work; older roadmaps provide a history of the project. We donâ€™t publish roadmaps for subminor versions. So 1.1 and 1.2 have roadmaps, but 1.2.1 does not.
